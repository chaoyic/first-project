    "### Conclusion...\n",
    "In this tutorial, we used the Quantopian research API to access and manipulate data related to stocks. Data includes stocks pricing data, trading volume and sentiment data related to a stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "### And more!\n",
    "However, as everyone who is interested in using computing power in financial marktet might wonder, what we are doing are just _**analysing the data**_, but is it possible for us to write an algorithm for a sepcific _**trading strategy**_ and test it on the Quantopian platform?\n",
    "\n",
    "Turns out that the answer is a firm \"Yes\". There is another different API, which is an IDE, that allows us to do backtesting(1) and paper trading(2) in stocks or futures on Quantopian.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out [Quantopian Algorithm](https://www.quantopian.com/algorithms) for these functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "1. backtesting: the process of testing a trading strategy on relevant historical data as if you are trading on live.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. paper trading: sometimes known as walk-forward, or out-of-sample testing. In paper trading, your algorithm gets live market data (actually, 15-minute delayed data in Quantopian) and 'trades' against the live data with a simulated portfolio.\n",
